This is a simple money transfer application packaged as a ratpack based microservice, completed as a test for Revolut.

The app has only one function - transfer

You can call the app as follows:

To return a simple string message (show it is working)
http://localhost:5050/

To perform a transfer
http://localhost:5050/transfer

and include a body like this:
{ "fromAccountId": 12345, "toAccountId": 23456, "amount": 150.99 }

The accounts are pre loaded when the application starts. This is of course very contrived, but you can see what is happening in the tests

In a real app I would probably use Flyway and Jooq for the SQL work, and I would certainly use Cucumber tests for integration - I just did not have time to do this now.
